# Node.js recruitment task



#Installation

1. Install dependencies

```npm i```

2. Run command

 ```npm test```

This application runs only under testing. I found unnecessary the idea of runnig the aplication and testing would do same. You can change ```customers.txt``` file for testing
porpuoses. I wanted to integrate this application also into docker container but I really had no time to do it. :(  

3. Build command

```npm run build```

Will add ```dist``` folder where is all transpiled TS into JS
